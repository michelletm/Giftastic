# Giftastic

This game allows the user to generate buttons that will call up gifs of their favorite tv shows. With each "add," more shows are stacked, along with their ratings. It offers the gifs in their static state, and allows the user to start and stop them with a click. This page is a good for working with APIs, and manipulating the information they return for the purposes of your website/app. Ultimately, the code could be maniupulated to search for gifs only within certain parameters (size, rating, color, etc).
